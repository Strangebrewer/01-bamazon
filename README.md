### 3-Challenges
This project is an exercise in reading and manipulating a MySQL database via Node.js. The main challenges include using recursion and callbacks, data validation and guarding against duplicate entries, and moderately complex (from a beginner standpoint) MySQL commands involving joins, aliases, and grouping. Lesser challenges include learning new Node packages - in this case, mysql and cli-table2.
